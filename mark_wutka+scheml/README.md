# Advent of Code 2021 - Scheml
I started off doing these in Common Lisp, but then I thought it might
be fun to see how far I can get in the
[Scheml](https://github.com/wutka/scheml) language I created for
a class in 2021.

You should be able to run each with:
```
scheml

Scheml Repl
> (load "day1.scm")
> (day1a)
[the answer to part A]
> (day1b)
[the answer to part B]
```
